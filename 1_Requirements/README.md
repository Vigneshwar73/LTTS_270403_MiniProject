## INTRODUCTION

  * It is a well-known fact that about 71 percent of the Earthâ€™s surface is covered by water, in which about 97.5 percent is salt water and only 2.5 percent is fresh water. Of the fresh water, only 0.3 percent is in liquid form on the surface, in the forms of underground water, aquifers, fresh water lakes and rivers. 
  * The high use of chemicals in manufacturing, construction, over-use of fertilizers in farms and also directly leaving the effluent water from industries into nearby water bodies have made a huge contribution to global water quality reduction.
  * Urbanisation and growing population have increased the demand for drinking water while the quality of water has been degrading continuously.
  * The WHO says that:
       > contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 4,85,000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.
