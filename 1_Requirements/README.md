# REQUIREMENTS 

## INTRODUCTION

  * It is a well-known fact that about 71 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, in which about 97.5 percent is salt water and only 2.5 percent is fresh water. Of the fresh water, only 0.3 percent is in liquid form on the surface, in the forms of underground water, aquifers, fresh water lakes and rivers. 
  * The high use of chemicals in manufacturing, construction, over-use of fertilizers in farms and also directly leaving the effluent water from industries into nearby water bodies have made a huge contribution to global water quality reduction.
  * Urbanisation and growing population have increased the demand for drinking water while the quality of water has been degrading continuously.
  * The WHO says that:
       > contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 4,85,000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.
  * Continuous water quality monitoring is an important tool for the management authorities to ensure safe drinking water supply to people. 
  * **The proposed water quality monitoring system consisting of basic sensors, microcontrollers, RF modules, is a compact system capable of collecting real-time data and transmitting it via wireless technology through Internet and displaying using a web application and also ensure fail-safe operation using Real-Time Operating System incorporated with the microcontroller.**

## LITERATURE REVIEW:
   * To quantify water quality, we need some parameters, measuring which we can come to a conclusion about the water quality. These parameters can be physical, chemical or biological. 
   * Indian Standard IS 10500:2012 specifies such parameters for checking drinking water’s quality. IS 10500:2012 gives several parameters, mentioning acceptable limits for each parameter and also permissible limits in the absence of alternate sources.
